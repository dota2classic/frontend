    "projectDescription": "General state of affairs on the project, who is involved, a bit of history.",
    "siteEssence": "What is the essence of the site?",
    "onlineOldDotaExplanation": "This site helps to play online in the old version of Dota 2. We offer login via Steam, convenient game search, client link, support and useful materials about the version.",
    "freeOldDotaOpportunity": "We give everyone the opportunity to play old Dota online for free. If you violate the rules, we can disable access to the service.",
    "whyOldDota": "Why old dota?",
    "differencesExplanation": "The game looks completely different now than it did 10 years ago. Some people liked the changes, some didn't, and we're not saying the old version is the best. But everyone might be interested in trying the original. Here's how they differ:",
    "oldMapDetails": "Old map - less neutral creep camps, roshan on the river, side shops.",
    "heroStatsDetails": "Heroes have much less health and mana and more damage - having 700 hp at 15 minutes is normal. Any ability in the lane spends a lot of mana, but also deals a lot of damage. Spending an ability to finish off a creep is a much more important decision.",
    "originalHeroesDetails": "Original heroes and their abilities - many abilities that in the current version either do not exist or have been greatly transformed. For example, Pudge, who is here affected by skill 2.",
    "roleSeparationDetails": "Hard role separation: support needs to gank to earn money. There are much fewer creeps on the map, and kills give a bigger reward.",
    "costToMaintainSite": "How much does it cost to maintain this site?",
    "expensesExplanation": "The project has 3 expense items:",
    "fixedExpenseDetails": "Required: renting servers for the site host and other infrastructure services (storage, analytics, databases). This part is almost fixed and costs about {{amount}} per month. In case of large influxes, this part also has to be scaled, expenses increase to {{amount}} per month.",
    "scalableExpenseDetails": "Scalable: depending on the online, we need a different number of game servers to ensure that everyone has enough slots to play. This expense is easy to predict: one optimal game server gives 3-4 parallel games, and costs {{amount}} per month. If the online is high, like during Pari Rivals 6.84, around 180 parallel players - we get about 30 parallel games, so the server expense will be {{amount}} per month.",
    "advertExpenseDetails": "Advertising: the most flexible part of expenses. Here we are very dependent on the supply on the market (which YouTubers are willing to cooperate for how much, for example), and, of course, our financial capabilities. We are always happy to collaborate, and we do not refuse cheap advertising :)",
    "approximateExpenses": "So, you can get approximate costs for maintenance: with a low online of 5-10 parallel games, this is {{lowOnline}} per month. If the online increases, advertising or news triggers, expenses can grow to {{highOnline}}.",
    "projectTeam": "Who is working on the project?",
    "projectHistoryExplanation": "Classic Dota has passed through many hands: Western enthusiasts were the first to start hosting games in 2019. After that, there were 2 communities for quite a long time: Western and CIS in the form of Discord servers. Then, from 2021 to the end of 2024, all games were on the site https://dota2classic.com From September 2024 to the present, all games are hosted on this site, the development and support of which is carried out by:",
    "developerDetails": "{{name}} - main developer of the site",

    "ancient678Details": "Ancient678 - created a CIS server for classic Dota",
    "samovarDetails": "Samovar Man - it was thanks to him that many players first saw classic Dota",
    "sittingBullDetails": "SittingBull - wrote the first automatic server host via discord bot, wrote the first server plugins",

    "konakonaqqDetails": "konakonaqq - help in writing server plugins",
    "otherContributors": "Many others - who are hard to remember, but they were definitely there and helped",
    "finalGoal": "What is the final goal of the project?",
    "stableOnlineGoal": "Stable online, which allows you to find a balanced game with players of a similar level in ± 10 minutes at almost any time of the day. A cozy place where it will be interesting to play for everyone: both newcomers to the old Dota and inveterate old-timers. The project's content is fully paid for by the players and there is a way out in the plus for a stable flow of advertising."
